The third opens the statue\'s inner safe, but not alone... you must have another key, a special one, which cannot be re-created or copied.<BR>You have to get it from the bank leader himself.<BR>Another problem: you can\'t move from one of the keyholes to reach the other, when you\'re about to open the inner safe. A trick must be applied, that\'s your problem."',

Probably almost certain death, huge danger, and so on... nothing special."<P>"Good. Before I can tell you anything, listen carefully: We have never met. You don\'t know me. You must NOT talk with anyone about this duty. I don\'t want to know your names, they don\'t matter. Are you really interested?"<P>"The target is to get a magical statue, which is guarded in the Swithand bank. We found an ancient passage that leads to the cellar of the bank. The passage is partly opened, and we closed some walls... check the cracks in the passage.<BR>You will find the entrance east from this place... Just half a hour walking.<BR>The statue is very important, and protected by multiple traps, keys and monsters. Even the owner could only access it after a hour...<BR>I have specialists, who will help you in your duty. In the northern barrack, just behind you, Coulner is working on the keys... he will be ready in an hour.<BR>Next to me, there\'s a door where you can find Owler. He\'s currently preparing two special weapons for you: the guards of the statue can only be harmed only by them.<BR>I have some supplies for you, in a barrel. Check that, a few steps to east.<BR>Now go on, get that statue for me. You\'ll be rewarded. The value of the statue is very high, but don\'t think you could keep it: noone would buy that from you."',
  ' 6| 7|Owler|"Greetings. I prepared the weapons for you. I think you should know that two mysterious beasts guard the statue. They\'ll appear when you step to the statue. They aren\'t dead, nor alive, and can be damaged only with these daggers. They\'re spell-resistant, of course, before you ask. Good news, heh?"',
